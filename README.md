# DCT-based-JPEG-image-Compression
This is a matlab implementation of the DCT-based JPEG image compression algorithm. Source codes are in the folder 'image compression', and a detailed documentation is provided in the folder 'documentation'. The documentation contains two files; 'DCT-based JPEG compression.pdf' is a report explaining the concepts of JPEG compression, the pipeline, and the conducted experiments and results. 'Modules_and_functions_description.pdf' is a technical documentation of all function and module usage, as well as a user manual to guide you through navigating the project files and running the test experiments.
